# Python script to check the page meta-comments in AGC source modules. 
# Looks for all .agc files in the current direcotry, and searches them for '## Page'
# directives. It checks the directives to verify that there are no incorrect page numbers
# (missing, extra, duplicated, out of sequence). 
#
# While the page numbers do not form part of the original AGC source, they are very important
# in the code conversion process, and in the debugging of errors in the rope binary files.
